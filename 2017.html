              During this robotics project we learned how to use GoPiGo, which was the robot and Rapsberry Pi, which was the motherboard and where you put all the code at for your robot.

               Here are the links to each of the challenges we did.
          <br>
            <a href="basic.txt">Challenge 0</a>. Driving Challenge: Navigate an obstacle course in the shortest time using the fewest keystrokes.
          <br>
            <a href="dance.txt">Challenge 1</a>. Dance Challenge:  Make your robot perform a “dance” in response to a single keystroke. The dance must include a sequence of at least 4 movements, including driving forward,
            reversing and rotating.
          <br>
            <a href="GoPiGo2.txt">Challenge 2</a>. Obstacle Challenge: Navigate a known obstacle course autonomously in the shortest time, using the fewest lines of code. See scale drawing for course layout.
			    <br>
			     <a href="servo.txt">Challenge 3</a>. Unknown Challenge:  Navigate an unknown obstacle course with user control in the shortest time using the fewest keystrokes and the fewest lines of code.
			    <br>
			     Challenge 4. Autonomous Challenge:  Navigate an unknown obstacle course autonomously in the shortest time.

               In this Arduino project, we were assigned a task to make something you chose to and just know how it works and how to describe it to someone else who does not know what 
			   is going on. Me and my partner decided to make a light show that goes with Mary Had A Little Lamb. We thought it was pretty unique. A struggle we had was to add a buzzer
			   that played the song but it was to complicated and every thing we tried did not work. But overall it was fun

            Challenge 0: Orientation challenge:
          </p>
       		<p>
       			In this challenge our objective was to just get used to the breadboard and how it works. We were assigned to basically wire on our own to make an LED light up. After we then took a simple quiz to test out knowledge to see if the LED will turn on or not.

            Challenge 1: Blink Challenge: 
          </p>
          <p>
            In this challenge our objective was to code the LED to blink and to last for 5 seconds and then turn off. Here is the link the our code: <a href="code1.txt">Challenge 1 Code</a>

          Challenge 2: User Input Challenge:
          </p>
          <p>
          In this challenge we were suppose to make a working circuit, where when the user would click a button, the LED would react to the click. We could have also used different kind of sensors. Link the our code: <a href="c2.txt">Challenge 2 Code</a>

          Challenge 3:

          <p>
          In challenge 3 we were assigned to program a light show that lights up and matches with the music that is coming out of the Raspberry Pi board. Link the our code: <a href="c3.txt">Challenge 3 Code</a>
